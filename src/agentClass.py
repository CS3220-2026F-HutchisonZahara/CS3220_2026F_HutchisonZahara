#This subclass of a base Thing class represents an Agent - based on lecture notes-3

# Agent is defined by describing its behavior
#How the insides work
#The job of AI -> design an Agent Program (implements the Agent Function)

#In general, the architecture
#1. makes the percepts from the sensors available to the program,
#2. runs the program,
#3. and feeds the program’s action choices to the actuators as they are generated


'''It has one required slot (attribute), .program, which reperesents Agent Program (the Core of Agent's logic).
Agent Program should hold a function that takes one argument, the Percept, and returns an action.'''

'''!!! Note that '.program' is a slot, not a method.
If it were a method, then the program could 'cheat' and look at aspects of the agent.
It's not supposed to do that: the program can only look at the percepts'''

'''
There is an optional slot, .performance, which is a number giving
the performance measure of the agent in its environment.'''
