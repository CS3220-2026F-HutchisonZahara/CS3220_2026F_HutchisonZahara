#This subclass of a base Thing class represents an Agent
'''It has one required slot (attribute), .program, which reperesents Agent Program (the Core of Agent's logic).
Agent Program should hold a function that takes one argument, the Percept, and returns an action.'''

'''!!! Note that '.program' is a slot, not a method.
If it were a method, then the program could 'cheat' and look at aspects of the agent.
It's not supposed to do that: the program can only look at the percepts'''

'''
There is an optional slot, .performance, which is a number giving
the performance measure of the agent in its environment.'''
